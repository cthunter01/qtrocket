If you want to help out and are looking for something to do, thank you! QtRocket is still in the early stages of development (as of 2023-04-24), but there are some
targets of development already that would be nice to have.

Here are some items that QtRocket needs help with and would probably take me a lot more time than someone already familiar:

* Windows build. I am not nearly as familiar with Windows development as I am with Linux/BSD, so if you can help in getting QtRocket to build and run in Windows that would be great!
I think it just needs a build of libcurl, libjson-cpp, and fmtlib to link against, and the Windows build of QtCreator can take care of the rest.
Having the source code to these libraries in a third-party subdirectory of the project that can be built along with the project may be the cleanest approach.
That way correct builds can be made on each platform without needing to track pre-built library versions, since those would be built and (statically) linked automatically.

* MacOS build. Same as with Windows. I don't own a Mac to actually try this out on, but would love to support that platform.

* Linux and xBSD builds. Testing on multiple distributions and BSDs is welcome. Fixing or reporting issues with a particular distribution/BSD would be welcome.
